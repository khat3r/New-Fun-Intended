No Fun Intended is a simple yet entertaining web application that allows users to create a bucket list of jokes to share during gatherings. You can manually add your own jokes or fetch random dad jokes from an external API to fill up your joke list. This project aims to solve a small problem I face when trying to prepare jokes (especially bad ones) for family gatherings by providing an easy way to collect and organize jokes.
### Objective

### Project Structure
- `src/AddItem.js` 📝 - Handles user input for manually adding jokes.

- `src/BucketList.js` 📜 - Renders the user's list of jokes.
- `src/RandomActivity.js` 🤖 - Fetches random jokes from an external API.
- `src/App.css` 🎨 - Styling for the application.
